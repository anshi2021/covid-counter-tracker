# covid-counter-tracker
It is an Android application that contains information about the Covid19 Virus. It contains detailed information about all countries. Daily case numbers, death numbers can be learned. I code the project in Java language and some tools like Picasso have been used.
I am using the api: https://covidtracking.com/data/api or https://corona.lmao.ninja/. Both apis will generate the number of patients and it will help in counting the number of patients.
Android Application: It will help in counting the number of patients.
Clicking on the countries from the main page or search screen goes to the detail page. There is a variety of information on the detail page. These are as follows : Today cases, Total test, Total case, Total recovered.
